	abstract = {1. Baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) are a popular tool to sample demersal fish assemblages and gather data on their relative abundance and body-size structure in a robust, cost-effective, and non-invasive manner. Given the rapid uptake of the method, subtle differences have emerged in the way stereo-BRUVs are deployed and how the resulting imagery are annotated. These disparities limit the interoperability of datasets obtained across studies, preventing broad-scale insights into the dynamics of ecological systems. 2. We provide the first globally accepted guide for using stereo-BRUVs to survey demersal fish assemblages and associated benthic habitats. 3. Information on stereo-BRUV design, camera settings, field operations, and image annotation are outlined. Additionally, we provide links to protocols for data validation, archiving, and sharing. 4. Globally, the use of stereo-BRUVs is spreading rapidly. We provide a standardised protocol that will reduce methodological variation among researchers and encourage the use of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) workflows to increase the ability to synthesise global datasets and answer a broad suite of ecological questions.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Evaluating the effects of marine reserves on exploited species can be challenging because they occur within a context of natural spatial and temporal variation at many scales. For rigorous inferences to be made, such evaluations require monitoring programmes that are replicated at appropriate scales. We analysed monitoring data of snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) in northeastern New Zealand, comprised of counts from baited-underwater-video surveys from inside and outside 3 marine reserves. Surveys were replicated at many levels, including areas inside and outside of marine reserves at 3 locations in 2 seasons, over a period of up to 14 yr, in an unbalanced design. The Bayesian modelling approach allowed the use of some familiar aspects of ANOVA, including mixed models of fixed and random effects, hierarchically nested structures, and variance decomposition, while allowing for overdispersion and excess zeros in the counts. Model selection and estimates of variance components revealed that protection by marine reserves was by far the strongest measured source of variation for relative densities of legal-sized snapper. The size of the effect varied across years among the 3 reserves, with relative densities between 7 and 20 times greater in reserves than in nearby areas. Other than the reserve effect, the temporal factors of season and year were generally more important than the spatial factors at explaining variation in counts. In particular, overall relative densities were {\textasciitilde}2 to 3 times greater in autumn than in spring for legal-sized snapper, although the seasonal effect was also variable among locations and years. We consider that the Bayesian generalised linear mixed modelling approach, as used here, provides an extremely useful and flexible tool for estimating the effects of management actions and comparing them directly with other sources of spatial and temporal variation in natural systems.},

	abstract = {Zero-inflated versions of standard distributions for count data are often required in order to account for excess zeros when modeling the abundance of organisms. Such distributions typically have as parameters λ, the mean of the count distribution, and π, the probability of an excess zero. Implementations of zero-inflated models in ecology typically model λ using a set of predictor variables, and π is fit either as a constant or with its own separate model. Neither of these approaches makes use of any relationship that might exist between π and λ. However, for many species, the rate of occupancy is closely and positively related to its average abundance. Here, this relationship was incorporated into the model for zero inflation by functionally linking π to λ, and was demonstrated in a study of snapper (Pagrus auratus) in and around a marine reserve. This approach has several potential practical advantages, including better computational performance and more straightforward model interpretation. It is concluded that, where appropriate, directly linking π to λ can produce more ecologically accurate and parsimonious statistical models of species abundance data.},

	abstract = {Effective management of wild populations of animals relies on having accurate methods for estimating their densities from field surveys. Surveying sharks and other highly mobile marine predators is particularly difficult, requiring specialised methods that can entail a range of potential biases. Recent simulation studies have suggested that non-instantaneous visual and video survey methods may overestimate densities of highly mobile fishes. A non-instantaneous method is one where each point in space is surveyed for a non-negligible period of time, rather than in an instantaneous ‘snapshot’, allowing animals to move into the survey space during the survey period. We conducted instantaneous and non-instantaneous surveys of sharks (Sphyrna lewini and Carcharhinus galapagensis) around Darwin and Wolf Islands (Galápagos Islands, Ecuador) using diver-operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) systems with towed GPS. We provide the first empirical evidence of non-instantaneous bias and show that the degree of bias is negatively related to diver swimming speed. At a speed of 40 m min-1, the non-instantaneous method recorded twice as many sharks as the instantaneous method. The bias may be as high as 10 fold at slow speeds (23 m min-1) and negligible at very fast speeds (65 m min-1). Moreover, we used GPS data to produce fine-scale distribution maps, revealing high densities in areas of strong currents along the south-eastern sides of both islands. We recommend the use of stereo-DOV systems with GPS and fast swimming speeds for surveying highly mobile sharks, to produce more realistic estimates of densities on which to base management of these species.},

	abstract = {Decades of overexploitation have devastated shark populations, leaving considerable doubt as to their ecological status1,2. Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats3. Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20\% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population. However, opportunities for the conservation of reef sharks remain: shark sanctuaries, closed areas, catch limits and an absence of gillnets and longlines were associated with a substantially higher relative abundance of reef sharks. These results reveal several policy pathways for the restoration and management of reef shark populations, from direct top-down management of fishing to indirect improvement of governance conditions. Reef shark populations will only have a high chance of recovery by engaging key socio-economic aspects of tropical fisheries.},

	abstract = {A better understanding of the patterns of distribution and abundance of sharks and their potential biological and environmental drivers is essential to develop and evaluate spatial management plans for conservation and fisheries. Benthic and pelagic baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) were used to describe spatial and temporal patterns in coastal shark assemblages in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). From 629 stereo-BRUV deployments, 877 sharks from 10 species were recorded. Shark assemblages displayed high spatial variation, likely in response to the diversity of habitats occurring in the GMR. The relative importance of environmental and biological drivers differed among shark species according to their mobility. Some species were widespread across the Galapagos Archipelago (GA) but occurred primarily only as either juveniles (Carcharhinus galapagensis) or adults (C. limbatus and Triaenodon obesus), while others were more spatially restricted and associated with geographical features (Sphyrna lewini and Galeocerdo cuvier) or specific habitats (Triakidae spp. and Heterodontus quoyi). The highest diversity of sharks was found in the Centre South bioregion of the GA, in areas with heterogeneous habitat and high overall fish diversity (islets and Floreana Island), while the greatest total abundance of sharks was recorded at the northern oceanic islands of Darwin and Wolf. Overall, the GMR harbours a unique coastal shark community that varies in composition across the GA. It is dominated by large semipelagic species but is also characterised by the presence of less mobile benthic species that are not found near other oceanic islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region.},

	abstract = {A global survey of coral reefs reveals that overfishing is driving resident shark species toward extinction, causing diversity deficits in reef elasmobranch (shark and ray) assemblages. Our species-level analysis revealed global declines of 60 to 73\% for five common resident reef shark species and that individual shark species were not detected at 34 to 47\% of surveyed reefs. As reefs become more shark-depleted, rays begin to dominate assemblages. Shark-dominated assemblages persist in wealthy nations with strong governance and in highly protected areas, whereas poverty, weak governance, and a lack of shark management are associated with depauperate assemblages mainly composed of rays. Without action to address these diversity deficits, loss of ecological function and ecosystem services will increasingly affect human communities.},

We want these resources to be available to future generations.\n\nProtecting fish stocks requires good management. And good management is a balancing act between protecting the ecosystem without being overly restrictive. If rules are too restrictive, people lose trust in our institutions and they might just flout the rules. Not restrictive enough, and we degrade our resources.\nTo ensure management is justified and effective, we need good information on…\nthe current state of populations, some measure of the abundance of individuals, and perhaps information on the size and sex structure of the population.\nPerhaps more importantly, we need to know something about population trends through time. This is true especially when there are changes to regulations.\n\nTo look at trends, we need regular monitoring. The more often we survey, the more information we have on trends. There’s simply no substitute for regular surveying if you want to assess trends.\n\nMonitoring fish is hard – trust me, I’ve spent most of my career counting fish using various methods and analysing the data. As my colleague Russel Millar once said: Counting fish is hard because you can’t see them, and they move.\nThere are myriad methods out there for quantifying fish populations, and each method has it’s advantages and disadvantages that make it appropriate or inappropriate for any particular scenario.\n\nFor example,\n\nfor broad-scale surveys across a continental shelf, research trawls might be a good idea. This sort of data can feed into bit fishery fish stock assessment models, which are typically done at large spatial and temporal scales, and require truckloads of historical catch data.\nin more sensitive, shallow, coastal environments, counts by scuba divers works\nTag-recapture methods can be used for some populations. You catch a bunch of fish, tag them, come back another time and catch more fish, and we can get an idea of the population from the proportion of tagged fish in the second visit.\nAnd, of course, many many other methods"

Here are the Catch Per Unit Effort numbers from these surveys, measured as kg of blue cod per pot. I’ve split them between inside the marine reserves vs outside the marine reserves.\n\nNo strong trend apparent there, but the last survey was a decade ago. Why?\n\nPotting is destructive method. It kills a lot of fish. For example, the 2014 survey captured over a tonne of blue cod, most of them killed.\n\nSuch losses may be ok for a large scale, productive fishery from which hundreds of tonnes are taken annually, but in a sensitive, enclosed environment like the fiords, many consider potting surveys to be inappropriate.\nIt is simply not fit for purpose.\n\nSo, there has been no potting survey since 2014, a full decade ago, which means we’re relying largely on anectodal evidence when making potentially contentious management decisions, which is not ideal.\n\nFurthermore, we don’t have hard data on what the current trends are for key species in Fiordland."

The numbers are what’s known as the “MaxN” count, which is the highest number seen on a single frame of the video.\nWe don’t just count every fish we see, because a single fish could circle the gear 100 times and get counted 100 times, and we can’t tell that situation from 100 individuals going by. Hence, the conservative approach of using a single frame.\nBy this method, we can get some very large counts, up to 38 individual blue cod here, with an average of 5.5 per deployment. We also did some surveys for DOC in the outer Hauraki Gulf this year, and got as many as 56 snapper in one frame.\nThe MaxN count from a single frame is the standard index of relative abundance that can be compared among sites and over time.\nWe also take measurements of lengths at different intervals, so that we can get a lot of information about the size-structure of the population."

Rob Priester\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what are some of the advantages of this method?\nFor a start, it’s much cheaper than a potting survey\nImportantly, it’s non-destructive. No fish were harmed to bring you these data.\nBecause it’s cost effective and non-destructive, we can do it more frequently.\nIt’s globally established, standardised methodology. I was a co-author on a published paper that established the standardised methods.\nThey can access all sorts of habitats at a broad range of depths. We’ve sent some systems down to 1200 metres (not these ones).\nThey’ll record anything that goes near a BRUV, all species of all sizes, as well as habitat information.\nThe fact that we have all this geographical and habitat information means that we can figure out what which areas and habitats are important to blue cod populations, at different parts of their life history.\nFinally, all the videos are stored in a permanent archive. We’ve extracted the data that we want, but the future opportunities are endless. These videos will likely be mined for information and projects we haven’t even thought of yet."

All that specialist calibration hardware and software, there are the frames, cameras, torches, and software for annotating the videos – it’s all quite expensive. But the good news is that I have all the gear already.\nWe don’t have much in the way of historical baselines of stereo BRUV data for Fiordland. We have two surveys using our gear, and there have been a few surveys by other groups as well, though they used different types of systems.\nOne disadvantage of not capturing the fish, like you do with pots, is that you cannot tell the sex of a blue cod unless you open it up and look at the gonads.\nIndeed, potting surveys suggest that heavily exploited blue cod populations are generally skewed in favour of males. This can be important information for large-scale stock assessment models, but in smaller, more enclosed areas like the fiords, this may not be as important as having good, fine scale information on abundance and size structure.\nIf this information is indeed crucial, there may be other ways of obtaining it with supplementary methods. I’ve heard mentioned the idea of asking recreational fishers to record their catches, and even the sex of fish."

There’s really no way around this.\nIf we wait five years between surveys, then after 15 years we’ll get the bare minimum number of time points to look at trends: three. Analysis of trends requires us to quantify variability among years, which requires multiple time points.\nLuckily, with BRUVs, we can do regular surveys because it’s relatively cheap and non-destructive.\nEvery year would be ideal, but every 2-3 years would allow us to get a good idea of trends in a reasonable timeframe.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the data are already being picked up by other research groups and government agencies. I can think of so many projects I’d like to do with the data.\nIn particular, I’m planning to do a direct comparison of the BRUV data with the historical potting data. We can examine exactly what information is needed by management and how well each method meets those needs as part of a formal cost-benefit analysis. I have an intern student coming from France next year who is interested in this project.\nWe could even do paired surveys with pots and BRUVs at the same sites in future. This would mean we have overlap of data with the two methods, potentially enabling us to integrate the historical timeline of the potting surveys with current and future surveys with BRUVs.\nAnd like I said, there may be scope to complement the BRUV data with other sources, such as from recreational fishers and citizen science initiatives like Fish Mainland."

Do they meet our objectives? Will they tell us what we need to know?\nI see a lot of potential here for stereo BRUVs. It is a globally established, cost-effective method that can provide good data not only on the abundance, size structure, and trends of key species, but it also a wealth of other information in Fiordland, one of the world’s most interesting and unique marine ecosystems.\nIf there is broad agreement that this work should continue, how can we ensure that it happens?\nWe’ve made a great start, but we have yet to secure funding to continue this work, or even report on what we’ve done so far.\n\nDOC is very supportive but it has a tonne of projects competing for limited funding and resources\nWhile MPI have been supportive, I get the sense that they prioritise work on stocks that are commercially harvested; and blue cod are no longer commercially harvested in the inner fiords\n\nSo although many people see the value of this project, there’s a risk that it’ll slip through the cracks of the major government agencies.\nIn my view, it would a shame to abandon this project after such a promising start, given the importance of monitoring to the management of these ecosystems for now and for future generations.\nThank you."

BRUVs have several advantages over many other methods of sampling fish communities, in that is efficient, non-destructive, and less species- and size-selective. The video footage becomes a permanent record of the habitat and biological community.\n\n\n\nThe BRUV unit comprises a metal frame, two video cameras in special housings, lights, and a long arm with a bait cannister.\n\n\nThe team at Sea Through Science have extensive experience with using underwater video methods across the world, including the Galapagos Islands1,2, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Rangitāhua/Kermadec Islands, the Poor Knights and Mokohinau Islands, all over the Hauraki Gulf3,4, and Fiordland. Adam co-authored the guide to the BRUV method5 and publications in Nature6 and Science7 as part of the Global FinPrint project."

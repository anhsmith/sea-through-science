## Who we are

Sea Through Science is led by **Dr Adam Smith**, a statistician and ecologist with over 20 years of experience in data analysis, advanced statistical modelling, and marine research.  

Based on Auckland’s Hibiscus Coast, I founded Sea Through Science to partner with researchers, organisations, and communities — helping to **bring your data to life** and turn complexity into clear, actionable insights.

## About Adam

I bring a rare mix of skills as both a **professional statistician** and an **ecologist**. My career has included fieldwork in New Zealand and overseas, lecturing and supervising research at university level, and collaborating with government agencies, scientists, and community partners. I have authored over [60 peer-reviewed publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5OvrU9IAAAAJ), reflecting a deep track record of rigorous, reproducible science.

I also work as a statistical consultant for [PRIMER-e](https://www.primer-e.com/), with whom I have taught more than 20 intensive, week-long courses in multivariate statistics around the world — including with [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) in Hawai‘i, the [University of Guam](https://www.uog.edu/), and institutions across South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. These experiences have shaped my ability to explain complex methods clearly and help diverse audiences apply them with confidence.

What drives me is making science **transparent, rigorous, and useful**. Whether through clear, customised analysis and presentation, conducting fisheries surveys, training scientists in advanced methods, or mentoring students on research design, my goal is to give clients clarity and confidence in their results.

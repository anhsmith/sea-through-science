## The BRUV method

Baited Remote Underwater Video, or BRUV, is considered the standard method for surveying fishes and habitats worldwide. BRUVs have several advantages over many other methods of sampling fish communities, in that is efficient, non-destructive, and less species- and size-selective. The video footage becomes a permanent record of the habitat and biological community.

The team at Sea Through Science have extensive experience with using underwater video methods across the world, including the Galapagos Islands [@smith_instantaneous_2020; @acuna-marrero_spatial_2018], New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, RangitƒÅhua/Kermadec Islands, the Poor Knights and Mokohinau Islands, all over the Hauraki Gulf [@smith_effects_2014; @smith_incorporating_2012], and Fiordland. Adam co-authored the guide to the BRUV method [@langlois_field_2020] and publications in *Nature* [@macneil_global_2020] and *Science* [@simpfendorfer_widespread_2023] as part of the [Global FinPrint](https://globalfinprint.org/) project.
